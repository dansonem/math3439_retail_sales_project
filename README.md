# math3439_retail_sales_project
Data science project 1 - data analysis on retail sales data
For my data science course (Math 3439), we are completing several projects. For project 1, my team analyzed retail sales data.
We were tasked with answering four questions:
1. How do holidays affect sales?
2. How do fuel prices affect sales?
3. How do unemployment rates affect sales?
4. Which combinations of these variables resulted in the best and worst sales weeks?

I was responsible for investigating the holiday variable. I found that holidays brought in a few days of big revenue, but overall, there wasn't a statistically significant relationship between holidays and weekly sales.
Other team members also found weak correlations between their variables and sales.
More information and figures can be found in the slides in "presentations", and the LinkedIn article in "article".

This project was my first time using Google Colab, and first time seriously working with Jupyter notebooks.
